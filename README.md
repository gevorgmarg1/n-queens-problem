# n-queens-problem
The pure Python code solves the popular N-Queens problem using backtracking algorithm

Input a number greater than 3 to see the solution for a given NxN board

The code prints an NxN Python list, where 0s represent empty cells and 1s the Queens

P.S.
The program does not work with 6x6, for an unknown reason, would appreciate a solution.
